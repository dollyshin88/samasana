# User Auth

## Functionality
- [ ] The main button with logo should link to `/`
- [ ] Smooth, bug free navigation

### Before Login

- [ ] The `/login` page should not display a link to `Log In`. Same for `/signup`
- [ ] Errors should display for both `/signup` and `/login`.
- [ ] Errors should clear when moving between `/signup` and `/login`.
- [ ] Can sign up a user
- [ ] Can sign in as a user
- [ ] Can log out a user
- [ ] Can't sign up with the same username/email
- [ ] Pressing enter after filling out the session form should use the form data, not the demo user

### After Login

- [ ] Should not be able to visit `/login` or `/signup`
- [ ] Should be able to refresh the page and still be logged in


## Style

- [ ] The site should look exactly like the actual site
- [ ] All relevant elements should have `cursor: pointer` on hover
- [ ] When errors are displayed, most elements should not move around the page (particularly input boxes)
- [ ] Remove Redux logger and all console.log()'s from production

## Seeds
- [ ] Adequate and appropriate seeds
